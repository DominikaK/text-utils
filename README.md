# text-utils

This repository is a collection of simple Python scripts for batch working on Markdown files,
intended for use in Markdown-based documentation.

- `replacer.py` performs a replace over all Markdown files in a directory and its subdirectories
- `link_checker.py` checks for image files that are not referenced anywhere in a set of markdown files.
